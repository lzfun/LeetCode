# LeetCode
:writing_hand: The purpose of this repository is to track my LeetCode progress and make some notes and summaries along the way.


#### :world_map: Data Structures / Methods Summary
- Two Pointers
  - [3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters]
  - [11. Container With Most Water]
  - [15. 3Sum]
  - [26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array]
  - [42. Trapping Rain Water]
  - [88. Merge Sorted Array]
  
- Breadth-first search (BFS) / Depth-first search (DFS)
  - [79. Word Search](79_word_search_v2.py)
    - Python: Can not use `[[0]*n]*m` to create list of list!!! The lists will refer to the same id!
  - [1162. As Far from Land as possible](1162_As_Far_from_Land_as_Possible.py)

- Hash Table
  - [380. Insert Delete GetRandom O(1)](380_insert_delete_getrandom.py)
    - Python: In Python 2, dictionary.keys() returns a list contains all the keys. But in Python 3, the same function would return an object called dict_keys([]), and it does not support indexing. Converting the object to a list would cost `O(n)` time.
